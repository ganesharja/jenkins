# jenkins
This is a repository created to host all learnings related to Jenkins starting from bascis to advanced pipelines using both Declarative Pipelines and Scripted Pipelines using Shared Libraries.

Pipline Types :
        v1 : Scripted Pipelines 

    v2 : DSL / Declarative Pipelines

    v3 : YAML [ Still in the development phase ]

## Naming Standard Of Jenkins Pipeline
    Pipelines are supposed to be enclosed in a file that end's with Jenkinsfile [ J as in caps ]
